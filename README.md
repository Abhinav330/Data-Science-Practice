## Introduction
The Data Science Projects folder contains various projects related to data analysis, machine learning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Each project focuses on a specific dataset and utilizes different techniques and algorithms to extract insights and make predictions.

## Purpose
The purpose of this documentation is to provide an overview of the projects and their functionalities. It serves as a guide for understanding the file hierarchy, dependencies, installation process, code explanation, usages, examples, error handling, best practices, troubleshooting, and limitations of the projects.

## Dependencies
The projects in this folder have dependencies on the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- category_encoders
- networkx
- cufflinks
- warnings
- json

## Installation
To run the code in these projects, the following libraries need to be installed:
```python
!pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn sklearn category_encoders networkx cufflinks
```

## Code Explanation
Each project contains a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) that includes code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, machine learning algorithms, and visualizations. The code is well-documented and includes explanations for each step.

## Usages
These projects can be used for various purposes, including:
- Exploring and analyzing different datasets
- Implementing machine learning algorithms
- Gaining insights from data through visualizations
- Predicting outcomes based on given features

## Error Handling
Possible errors that may occur include missing dependencies, incorrect file paths, or incompatible data formats. To resolve these errors, ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly, check the file paths in the code, and verify that the data is in the expected format.

## Best Practices
To ensure the correct usage of the code, follow these best practices:
- Install the required dependencies before running the code.
- Read the documentation and code comments for a better understanding of each project.
- Use appropriate data preprocessing techniques based on the dataset.
- Evaluate the performance of machine learning models using appropriate metrics.
- Handle missing values and outliers appropriately.
- Visualize the data to gain insights and validate the results.
