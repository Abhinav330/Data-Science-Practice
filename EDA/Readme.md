## Introduction
This code documentation is for "Hello World" code in Python. "Hello World" code is one of the simplest program that outputs the same text. It is mostly used as a simple test to see if a programming language is working correctly or not.

## Purpose
The purpose of this documentation is to provide stakeholders with the description about "Hello World" code, its dependencies, installation, usage, examples, error handling, best practices, and troubleshooting.

## Dependencies
This code does not have any dependencies and can run on any system with Python.

## Installation
There is no need to install any external libraries to run this code as Python has "print" function in-built.

## Usages
"Hello World" code is mostly used for testing and debugging purposes. This code is also used as the simplest possible program in order to demonstrate how to print output in any programming language.

## Examples
The following are some examples of how to use "Hello World" in Python:

### Easy level example
```python
print("Hello World")
```
Output: 
```
Hello World
```

### Medium level example
```python
name = "Alice"
print("Hello " + name)
```

Output:
```
Hello Alice
```

### Hard level example
```python
x = 10
y = 20
result = x + y
print("The result of addition is", result)
```

Output:
```
The result of addition is 30
```

## Error Handling
The following errors might occur while using "Hello World" code:

1. Syntax Error:
   ```
   print("Hello World" 
   ```
   Solution:
   The error might occur due to the missing bracket in the code. To resolve this error, add an extra closing bracket.

2. Syntax Error:
   ```python
   print "Hello World"
   ```
   Solution:
   The error occurs due to a missing pair of parentheses. You should insert parentheses after the print statement to fix the error:
   
   ```
   print("Hello World")
   ```

3. Name Error:
   ```python
   prin("Hello World")
   ```
   Solution:
   The error occurs due to the wrong spelling of print. You should replace "prin" with "print".

## Best Practices
To ensure proper use of "Hello World" code, follow these best practices:

- Ensure that the spelling of the code is correct.
- Always use proper syntax.
- Don't forget to use quotations while printing any string.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues using "Hello World" code, please refer to [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) for more information.

## Limitations
The limitations of "Hello World" code are as follows:

- It cannot be used to fulfill complex programming needs.
- It can only be used to print output.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, "Hello World" code is the simplest code in Python programming language and is used primarily to test the basic functionality of printing output in the language. It is easy to implement and can be used for testing and debugging purposes.
